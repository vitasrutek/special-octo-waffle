CLI AirMusic control internet radios

I bought new internet radio Kruger&Matz KM0816 that has capabilities to play DLNAs and network radio stations.
It had remote controller but also had Android application called AirMusic.
This is useful application that use simple HTTP-GET commands to control radio.
I wanted to use this feature to automate radio turning on / off when I am home or not

AirMusic uses more manufactures such as Audizio, Sencor, Silvercrest, GoGen.
